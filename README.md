# CityOS
This is code that could hypothetically manage a city. Events occur across maps or sequentially, and operators, through AI augmentation.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project from a larger scale is the focus on building a technology that will be part of what “Smart Cities” is.
This idea that all cities will be digitally integrated and provide means and permissions for access to data streams and APIs is powerful,
and I believe it is the future. Therefore my motivation is simply to be a part of it.

The University of São Paulo has a unique position to be able to open up their network to development. 
They’ve invested heavily on this system, and provided the access to the IT group rather than the police. 
This means that I can go in and provide some kind of data analysis.
